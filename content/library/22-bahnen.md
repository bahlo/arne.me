Tilda lives with her little sister Ida and her alcoholic mother in a small
town.
She works as a cashier at the supermarket and every work night goes to the
public pool to swim 22 lanes.
Her friends have moved away and she has to take care of her little sister.
Then she gets an offer to do her PhD in Berlin and at the same time Viktor
shows up.
Can she leave her little sister with her mother?

I had a hard time getting into this book, but once I committed I enjoyed it.
Itâ€˜s got melancholy, love and small everyday moments.
It's like a window into a life.
