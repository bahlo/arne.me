This book is about racism in Germany and how you as a reader can leave 
"Happyland", the place where you're ignorant of racism as a _white_ person.
Tupoka Ogette talks about German colonialism, micro-agressions, othering, 
structural racism and how racism is learned implicitly as a child.

The book is built like a workshop; each chapter is split into an input part and
an interactive partâ€”often with links to articles and videos.
This book should be required reading in Germany.
It makes you more aware of everyday racism, situations where you are racist
(event if unintentional), and helps you make a difference.

I ordered the physical version of the book to hand out to everyone of my _white_
friends and family.
