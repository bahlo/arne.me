Ever since the Epstein drive was invented, humanity can travel to the stars.
There's a colony on Mars and in the "Belt".
But when two ships are destroyed by an unknown actor, it steers the already
fragile relationship between these fractions into war.

The book is split into two stories, alternating each chapter.
One follows Miller, a cop on a space station in the Belt, the other follows
Holden, an "earther" and the XO of a (space) water freighter.
One thing comes to the other and Holden finds himself captain of a ~stolen~
salvaged Mars gunship, Miller is out of a job for not dropping the job to 
find Julie Mao.
What does she have to do with the war? And who's behind all of it?

I loved reading this book.
The concepts are fascinating, the story is thrilling and the characters are
interesting.
Even if you've watched the Prime series, I cannot recommend this enough.
