Book #3 of the Expanse series and, same as the
[earlier](https://arne.me/library/leviathan-wakes)
[books](/library/calibans-war), this one is an amazing read.
I've actually started to read other books in between the Expanse books and read
these as a reward.

James Holden and his crew of the Rociante (the salvaged Mars warship) end up
at a mysterious ring structure, created by the Protomolecule, an alien lifeform.
What they find there changes everything.
I don't think I can say more without spoilers.

This book is more serious than the earlier ones, with more politics, ethics,
and more complex characters.
If you're into science fiction and haven't read these, you're missing out!
