In an aging society that is tipped even more towards older people by the Boomer
generation, children are at a disadvantage.
This book analyses the situation in Germany and provides possible solutions to
it.
With future generations becoming smaller and smaller, we need to make sure to
foster every single child as much as we can.

This book is more scientific than I initially expected, but I loved the deep
dive! This is probably most relevant to people working in schools,
kindergartens, or other institutions working with children.
