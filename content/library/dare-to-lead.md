This book is split into four parts:

1. Rumbling with vulnerability
2. Living into our values
3. Braving trust
4. Learning to rise

Brené takes from data she's collected from interviewss and research and shares
what she's learned in this book.

One part I particularly enjoyed was where she compares _armored leadership_ with
_daring leadership_ using concrete examples—very hands-on.

While I liked this book, I had to push myself to finish it.
For me personally a more concentrated version would've worked better, but I
would recommend this nonetheless.
