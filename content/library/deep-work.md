In this book, Cal Newport distinguishes between _deep work_ and _shallow work_.
Deep work is valuable, requires skill and, most importantly, focus.
Shallow work is the opposite.
After defining the many benefits of deep work, Newport gives concrete advice on how to implement this in your life, from time blocking to social media and email techniques.

If you feel like spending too little time working on things that really matter, this book is for you.
But even if you don't, it can help you bring structure and intentionality to your life.
It helped me think differently about how I work, and I can already see positive effects.
