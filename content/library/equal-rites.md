On the Discworld, every eighth son of an eighth son can become a wizard.
When an old wizard, at the end of his life, touches the eighth son of an eighth son, it turns out it's actually a daughter.
And women can't be wizardsâ€”or can they?

Eskarina Smith is the name of the girl, and she is so full of magic, that Granny Weatherwax, a witch, takes her in and teaches her the herbs and "headology".
But is that enough? Does Esk want to be a witch or a wizard?

This book is the third novel in the Discworld series and was published in 1987, but is still shockingly relevant.
Really liked it!
