Case is a console cowboy in Japan, who was caught stealing and punished by
getting his nervous system damaged.
When Molly, a razorgirl, approaches him for a shadowy figure who promises to
heal him in exchange for his services as a hacker, Case has little choice but
to say yes.

This is a great book in 2025, I cannot imagine what it was like reading it in
1984, the year it was published.
Many concepts are part of modern science fiction works (especially cyberpunk)
and you can really tell why this is seen as one of the defining works for the
genre.
William Gibsonâ€™s writing is incredible, and the world fascinating.
I especially liked the 3D representation of the matrix, representing firewalls
as ice that is covering an entity.
Great book!
