Another great book, fourth in the Expanse series.
The ring opened a portal to a thousand worlds, and the first world humans land on is called Illus.
Or New Terra, depending on who you ask.
The "squatters", people who went to the planet to start a new civilization and RCE, a research corporation who got legal charter rights from the UN, whatever that means, are fighting for the land.
When the landing pad explodes, taking the RCE landing shuttle with it, a spiral of escalation and death begins.
Holden and his team on the _Rocinante_ are asked to mediate, but on arrival are presented with a complicated situation, which is only getting worse.

It's a good book, and it fits well into the series.
I kind of missed the action scenesâ€”they're one of the best things about the espanse books, and this book was all about deescalation.
Still, interesting dynamics at play and the multi-perspective storytelling continues to add variety to the story.
