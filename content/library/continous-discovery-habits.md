The goal of this book is to help you understand continuous discovery habits; to
build better products, for you and your customer. 
Teresa Torres introduces opportunity solution trees, explains why you should
measure success by product outcome, the importance of customer interviews and
mapping the opportunity space.

This might be actionable at companies with large product teams and large
projects that need to be plannedâ€”while reading this with a startup in mind I
found it hard to map to my day-to-day, although I picked up some ideas I want
to implement.

I personally would've gotten more from this book if it started with a practical
application of these habits, to first get an overview of what this book helps
you achieve and with what. 
During the first half of the book it was all this theory with little insight on
the value of it, that came in the second half.
One of the last chapters has practical advice how you can start implementing
some of these habits at your current workplace.
 
If this is interesting to you, go give it a read, but I recommend starting with
chapter fourteen.
