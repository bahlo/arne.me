The year is 1806 and magic is coming back to England.
Mr Norrell is the first practicing magician since four hundred years, when
John Uskglass, The Raven King, disappeared.
Norrell is reclusive and cautious about magic, while his scholar, Jonathan
Strange is brilliant and eccentric.
These two famous English magicians, who could not be more different, soon find
themselves in over their heads.

Susanna Clarke, who also wrote [Piranesi](/library/piranesi), builds a fantastic
world full of mysteries and twists.
If you decide to read this, you need to commit to it.
This book has a thousand pages, and while I was struggling to read the first
half, the second half more than made up for it with a faster story and more
magic.
