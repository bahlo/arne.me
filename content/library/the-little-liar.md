This book tells four parallel storylines:
Nico, Sebastian and Fannie are Greek Jews and Udo is a Nazi.
The book spans a time range from 1943 to 1980 and shares what they live through,
all spoken from the character "Truth".
The horrifying atrocities in the death camps, the lies about where the trains
are going, and how Nico, the little liar, unknowingly betrayed thousands of
Jews, something he could never recover from. 

I like the stories of the book, I think itâ€˜s important to show the lives that,
although fictional, are based on real experiences.
For me it had a few too many happy accidents and too much writing on a
meta-level, but if you can gloss over that, this is a good read!
