After [Cibola Burn](/library/cibola-burn), the salvaged Mars navy warship _Rocinante_ needs repairs on Tycho Station.
Three of the four crew members, Naomi, Amos and Alex use the time to catch up with their past while Holden stays at Tycho to co√∂rdinate repairs.
Suddenly everything changes and all four of them find themselves in catastrophe, far away from each other.

Reading this book feels like watching an action movie. The rotating perspectives, the battle scenes, the incredible character development, the variety in location and challenge.

Loved it.
