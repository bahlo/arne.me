This book is a mixture of storytelling and advice.
Tony Fadell, who helped create the iPod and founded Nest, shares his experience
for building yourself, your career, your product your business, your team
and being CEOâ€”both in small startups and large companies.

I got most of the value from the earlier sections, but knowing how things can
work in general was super interesting as well.
If you work in tech, this is a good book to read, it's full of valuable insights
and interesting anecdotes.
