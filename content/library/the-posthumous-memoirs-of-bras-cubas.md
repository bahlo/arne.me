This book was published in 1881 and is regarded as one of the greatest works of
Brazilian literature.
It's written from the perspective of Brás Cubas, who starts his memoirs with his
own death, followed by loosely-connected chapters.

He is narrating the whole book, sharing his thoughts and sometimes directing
passages to the "ignorant" reader themselves.
Topics include his early life and education, his love affair and his struggle
for power and glory.

> Since life is the greatest benefit the universe can bestow, and there is no
> beggar who does not prefer poverty to death (which is itself a delightful
> influx of Humanitas), it follows that the transmission of life, far from being
> an occasion for gallanting, is the supreme hour of a spiritual Mass. 
> Hence there is truly only one misfortune in life: never being born.

To be honest, I had a hard time with this book and I probably wouldn't have
finished it if it wasn't for a book club.

Is this book for you? I really don't know.
Someone in the book club described it as "Forrest Gump, but not uplifting."
