**Warning:** This is the 7th book in the Expanse series, so this review will
contain spoilers. If you want to avoid them, know that I love it and you should
read it (but read the other 6 first)!

It's been three decades since Admiral Winston Duarte and his roughe fleet from
the MCRN (Mars Congressional Republic Navy) moved through the Laconia gate.
They completely blocked access and did not let anyone in during that time.<br>
Camina Drummer is the president of the Transport Union, who controls the gates,
the crew of the Rocinante does contract work and things start to look normal.
Until a huge alien-looking battleship comes through the Laconia gate and claims
power over systems connected with the Slow Zone (including Sol). 

It's less space fights than other books and not a lot of time on the Rocinante,
but it fits well with the other books and I loved reading it!
