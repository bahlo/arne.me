Saturo adopts a stray cat when it‘s hit by a car.
He calls him Nana, they become friends and, after a few years of living together, they take a road trip to visit a few friends.
This trip shows how strong that friendship really is and reveals a deeper reason: Saturo has to give Nana away. But why?

After reading a few heavy books in our book club, latest being [Parable of the Sower](/library/parable-of-the-sower) and [Parable of the Talents](/library/parable-of-the-talents), this is a comforting change.
It‘s nicely written and I loved the chapters from the Cat‘s perspective.

In the end it didn’t really hook me–it was a nice story, but that‘s about it.
