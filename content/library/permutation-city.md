It‘s 2050 and humanity has the technology to scan brains and run them in a 
virtual reality—at 17x slowdown.
Paul Durham, or rather a copy of him, finds himself in one of these
environments, proving a theory of his. Will it work? And what is the meaning
of the _Autoverse_, a crude digital replication of atoms and elements
virtualized on a computer?

This is one of the books that leave you with lingering thoughts and
concepts—of reality and time itself. I loved how the concepts and their
limitations are explained, instead of being stated as facts.
If you like science fiction, highly recommend!
