Philip Banse and Ulf Buermeyer take on 8 structural problems of Germany in these
areas:

* Infrastructure
* Digitalization
* Public transportation (esp. Deutsche Bahn)
* Clean energy
* Social inequality
* Edcuation
* Pensions
* Federalism

They dive deep into each topic, adding references and suggesting solutions.
This gives insight into the background of these problems, which people
experience everyday.
Sometimes it's the work of a political party, sometimes it's misunderstandings,
more often than not it's just negligence.

In the epiloge, they adress their priviledged perspective and everyday racism
in Germany.
I love their weekly politics podcast 
[Die Lage der Nation](https://lagedernation.org), and this book adheres to the
same high quality bar.
Great read!
