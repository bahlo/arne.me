This book, which is the prequel to _How to Live_, talks about truth, beliefs,
and reframing.

Here are four points that really resonated with me (there are so many more in
the book):

> When someone tells you what something means, it's never true because it's not
  the only answer.

> Nothing has inherent meaning. Whatever meaning you project into it is your
  own.

> Beliefs are often self-fulfilling. Wether you think you can or can't, you're
  right.

> No choice is the best in itself. A choice becomes the best when you choose it.

Reading this book can change how you think about the world, reframe and find
other perspectives.
It's a must-read, at least from my perspective.
