Lauren is 15 and lives with her family and neighbours in a walled cul-de-sac.
Sometimes they leave those walls, to work, run errands, or to practice shooting.
Outside is a dangerous place: wild dogs will attack and try to eat you, people
who are desperate and will try to kill you to steal everything you have with
you.
Over time, the break-ins get worse and Lauren has to make plans for what happens
if her neighbourhood is overrun.

This book is written in diary-form, from the perspective of Lauren.
It's post-apocalyptic, in a way, but it's an interesting setting as the currency
still holds, there's companies, police, fire department, even a
presidentâ€” everything still exists, but not in an effective way.
How can you find hope in a world as broken as this?
How can you trust strangers?

I really enjoyed reading this, it was entertaining and thrilling, although
really brutal at times.
If you can stomach that, I recommend reading this.
