This is a re-imagination of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Twain, 1884).
The twist: It's written from the perspective of Jim, a slave who later calls
himself James.
They run away together—Jim because he hears that his owner plans to sell him
and Huck because of his abusive father.

I read the original when I was a kid, reading this now reminded me of the great
feeling of adventure—which arguably is dampened by the harsh reality of Jim
being black in America in 1840.

This book is amazingly written, I couldn't put it away.
