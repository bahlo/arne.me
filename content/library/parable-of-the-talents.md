Parable of the Talents is part two in the Earthseed series.

Lauren, Bankole and the rest of their group start building their community at
the land that Bankole earns.
They grow their own food, trade with neighbours and even build a school.
Lauren preaches her Earthseed religion and converts more and more people.
But when Jarret becomes president and starts his "Christian America" initiative,
their small cult needs to be careful to not get into trouble.

This book is written from the perspective of Laurens daughter, though most of it
continues to be diary entries from Lauren.
It's even more brutal than the first one, so be warned.
But it's a great continuation of the first book!
