This is the second book of The Expanse series, I also
[reviewed the first one](/library/leviathan-wakes).

The crew around James Holden investigates the reason for a military escalation
between the already tense UN (Earth) and Mars for the OPA (Outer Planet's
Association).
A scientist's daughter was abducted during the kerfuffle, and they agree to help
find her.
What does the missing girl have to do with the escalation?
And why does the Protomolecule on Saturn react to certain events?

While the first book was written mostly from two alternating perspectives, this
one has four: Holden (the captain), Prax (the scientist), Avasala (the senior
politician) and Bobbie (the Martian marine).
These perspective shifts are an amazing device for storytelling.

Another book I couldn't put away.
It's really good!
