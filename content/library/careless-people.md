Sarah Wynn-Williams tells the story of Facebook, from her perspective.
She joined the company with the intention to make a positive impact on the world;
to connect people and provide value for humanity.

The book contains interesting stories of Mark Zuckerberg meeting world leaders and how that is handled from Facebook's side.
While working with Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook executives and employees, she slowly learns that most of them put other values, like growth and success, above all else.
She showcases many pathways where Facebook could've done the right thing, taken responsibilityâ€”but didn't.
On top of she is experiencing sexual harassment that is swept under the rug and leads to her being fired.

It's a good book, you should read it.
There's shocking revelations, that confirm what you've been probably assuming anyway, if you paid attention.

So, how do I get off WhatsApp?
