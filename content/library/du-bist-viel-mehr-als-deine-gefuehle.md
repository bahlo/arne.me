This book helps you understand your nervous system and how to work with it,
not against it.

Jeannine Mik, an expert in emotional health, explains the interactions between
your body, your nervous system and your emotions.
She provides tools to get out of a dysregulated state and become more present in
your everyday life.

Being aware of the state of your nervous system and getting a feel for where you
are on the ladder from Dorsal to Ventral is fascinating and super helpful in
everyday life.
You need to be ready to look at yourself and understand how you work to get the
most out of this book, but if you are I cannot recommend this enough.
