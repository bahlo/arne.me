This book is actually two books—kind of.
The chapters alternate between "Hard-Boiled Wonderland" and "End of the
World"[^1].

In _The Hard-Boiled Wonderland_, we follow a _Calcutec_, a human data processor
who is doing an encryption assignment for a professor and finds himself in the
middle of a huge conflict between the _Semiotecs_, who want to steal data, as
well as _INKlings_, violent entities who live in the sewers and worship a fish.<br>
The _End of the World_ is about a man who arrives in a surreal town with high
walls, unicorns and people without a mind.
On entry, his shadow is cut off, and he's given the job of the "Dreamreader",
which reads dreams from skulls in the library.

I enjoyed guessing how the two stories are related, or if they even are.
Both worlds and both stories are interesting in their own way, though I found
myself looking forward to the next _Hard-Boiled Wonderland_ chapter—mostly
because that story has more action and suspense.
The underlying concept is fascinating, and it has a few "oh snap"-moments
towards the end.
If you like surreal books with novel concepts, I recommend reading this one.

    The audiobook is even spoken by two people, putting more emphasis on this
    concept.
