I‘m trying to be more intentional with my life (there‘s a work-in-progress blog post that might or might not be released soon), and want to give Bullet Journalling a go. This book gives you everything you need to get started, and then some. It‘s a great guide to understand how and why it can help you every day to reflect and think about what you spend your time on.

If you‘re interested in BuJo, this is a must-read.
