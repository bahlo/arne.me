I'm addicted to my phone. You are probably too.

And I'm trying to fix this: I don't have TikTok[^1] or Instagram, I only use YouTube in Safari with [Shorts blocked](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockyt-for-safari/id1575379461), and I use [one-sec](https://one-sec.app) for apps that I don't want to waste my time on. But still, time-sinks keep creeping in after a week or two.

So, I did what I wanted to do for years: I put my iPhone at my desk and left it there for 7 days[^2]. Here's how it went.

## The setup

Here's all the things I can do reasonably effective with my Apple Watch Ultra 2:

- Inspect and create calendar events
- Manage my tasks with the [OmniFocus 4](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) watch app
- Send and receive texts with a swipe-capable on-screen keyboard or voice input
- Make and receive phone calls
- Track my hydration using [Waterminder](https://waterminder.com)
- Track medication
- Check the weather with [Carrot Weather](https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/)
- Record workouts with [Gentler Streak](https://gentler.app)
- Record voice notes with [Just Press Record](https://www.openplanetsoftware.com/just-press-record/)
- Navigate to and in places with Maps
- Listen to music and podcasts with Apple's apps

I also utilized the Action Button to run a Shortcut with the following menu:

- New OmniFocus inbox item
- Start audio recording
- Toggle my office light (for that sweet sweet Rembrandt lighting)
- Defer OmniFocus items to tomorrow (you can't do that using the watchOS app)

## How it changed my everyday life

Instead of being constantly reachable—not only via text or calls, but also via email and socials, I sat down in the evenings for some admin time.
In that time, I would check and reply to emails and non-iMessage text messages, as well as going through OmniFocus and Just Press Record data to clean it up.

But besides that time, I was just—present. When I was out and about and waiting for something, I was forced to just _wait_. This gave me time to reflect and think things through, a time I didn't know I was missing. Instead of having to make an effort to not look at my phone when I'm with friends, I was relaxed because I had no other choice. And instead of doom-scrolling while watching a TV show on the couch, I just watched the TV show (a nice side effect is that this raises the bar of content you consume).

But there were some downsides: I bought a new pair of glasses in that week and had no phone to make a quick photo (I hope I still like them when they arrive this week, lol). My watch had an issue with phone calls one morning, so I couldn't make or take phone calls (a restart eventually fixed it). My 4-year-old complained that I can't play an audiobook or music for him while in the car. Because the swipe keyboard was not as reliable as I wished it'd been, I used the voice input in places where it might be awkward. I had to take a piece of paper to write things down that I needed to remember (like the model of the lenses for my new glasses).

Here's a guest contribution from my wife:

> This husband of mine has many ideas. The "I dump my phone"-experiment was not my favorite one. I'm all for reducing your screen time and limiting doomscrolling. But being unreachable because your Apple Watch decides to throw a tantrum, not being able to answer quickly to a text or to capture an important family moment because you don’t have a camera—that’s just not practical, especially when you forget to recharge your watch. So this little experiment drove me crazy more than once tbh—and I am a little relieved it’s over now. I really do hope he still likes his new glasses when they arrive. It never gets boring with this one.

## Should you do this?

This heavily depends on how much you are willing to give up. You can carry a notebook and pen and a camera and fix some of the issues noted above. Maybe you don't need to text as much.

I definitely recommend trying it; I got my phone back today, and I appreciate both the flexibility—I can do almost anything with it—and being more present in some situations.

That being said, I was looking forward to getting my phone back after four days. Worth a try.

[^1]: I tried TikTok for a few days and had ~4h screen time per day just for that app.
[^2]: Full disclosure: I made one exception when I had to drive somewhere with navigation and my Watch was at 10%.
