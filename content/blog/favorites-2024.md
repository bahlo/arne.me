Here are my favorite things, digital and physical, of 2024! 

## Music

* [I Love You So F\*\*\*ing Much by Glass Animals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8tkzXKlhGxltN2yyQwjlkd6jZVknhj9l):
  One of my favorite bands, every single album is amazing. and this is no
  exception.
* [Clancy by Twenty One Pilots](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3roRV3JHZzbatp5PvE-88ApmVishqGHN):
  There's artists with unique story telling and then there's Twenty One Pilots.
  I really like this album.
* [From Zero by Linkin Park](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlqZM4covn1HF92FlF7W5nUI_Ixh2m3Rk):
  This sounds like Hybrid Theory reloaded—which is a good thing—and I love that they're back.
* [Older (and Wiser)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgpybwCcUnBV9ydEM2ReIB1ycE3BxAX_4):
  This is the music you want to hear on long train rides through the country
  side and on long winter evenings.

## Books

These links go to my reviews (no spoilers):

* [Piranesi by Susanna Clarke](/library/piranesi): One of the best books I've
  ever read.
* [Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir](/library/project-hail-mary): Loved the book
  and told everyone about it after reading it.
* [The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey](/library/leviathan-wakes): 7 books
  plus a few novellas. Couldn't stop reading!
* [Useful Not True by Derek Sivers](/library/useful-not-true): One of the books
  that change how you think about the world, incredible read.

## Apps

* [Manet](https://tilo.dev/manet/): I've started buying my music and hosting it
  myself this year[^1], this app makes it a joy to listen to music.
* [CouchTimes](https://couchtim.es): The best TV show tracker in the App
  Store, period. It doesn't have feature bloat and it respects your privacy.
* [Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty): A super fast, new Terminal emulator
  for the Mac.
* [Halide](https://halide.cam): This camera app has been around for a while, but
  this year they released _Process Zero_, a mode that applies minimal
  corrections and makes photos look more like digital camera photos.

## Goods

* [aranet4](https://aranet.com/en/home/products/aranet4-home): There are cheaper
  options, but a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor for my home office has helped me
  keep the air at good levels.
* [heat-it](https://heat-it.com): This tiny tool draws power from your phone
  to relieve itch & pain from insect bites.
* [Leatherman 2H Wave+](https://www.leatherman.com/de_DE/2h-wave-638.html):
  The only big Leatherman that's legal to carry in Germany, super versatile and
  handy to have around.
