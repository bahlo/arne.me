I listen to a lot of podcasts every day, e.g. when doing chores or commuting. One of the shows I particulary enjoy recently is [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex), where Myke Hurley and CGP Grey talk about their ways to be productive. 
Every year, they define yearly themes, which are a bit like new year's resolutions, but instead of hard targets, they are more like directions in which you want to go.
I highly recommend listening to the [Yearly Themes Episode of 2019](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/79).

Since this is such a good idea, I naturally defined my own yearly themes for 2019. One of those is called _Year of Automation_, which to me means automating everything I can in my personal as well as professional life.

I will try and documente all bigger efforts (you don't want to see all my email rules) in this blog series.
