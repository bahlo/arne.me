I'm currently reading Dare to Lead (Brown, 2018) and this made me think:

> When worthiness is a function of productivity, we lose the ability to pump
> the brakes. The idea of doing something that doesn't add to the bottom line
> provokes stress and anxiety. It feels completely contrary to what we believe
> we want to achieve in life—we convince ourselves that downtime, like playing
> with our kids, hanging out with our partners, napping, tooling around in the
> garage, or going for a run is a waste of precious time. Why sleep when you can
> work?

Although I'm not a workaholic, I do see myself in some of these points.<br>
I need to work on that.
