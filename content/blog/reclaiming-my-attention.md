Our attention is being stolen.<br>
We're slowly losing the ability to concentrate, not only because of TikTok, but
also because we constantly have access to _easy_ consumption.
It's digital fast food.

When I started to notice this on myself, I started with the naÃ¯ve approach and
deleted all time sink[^1] apps like YouTube or Instagram.
This worked for a day or two until I either got bored or found another reason to 
re-install.

Then I moved to Apple Screen Time.
This works for a bit, but that "15 minutes more" button starts to become muscle
memory very quickly.
Even apps like [one sec](https://one-sec.app) got deleted because they're
annoying (that's the idea, I know).

In January 2024 I went [7 days with only my Apple Watch](/blog/i-lived-7-days-without-a-smartphone),
leaving my iPhone at my desk at all times.
It was doable, but very impractical.

## None of this worked

In early 2025 I sold my Apple Watch and bought a Casio DW-5600BB-1.
This had a large impact as I would no longer get buzzed on my wrist for every
notification[^2].

Then I deleted my Instagram account and the YouTube, Mastodon and Bluesky apps. 
Yes, a lot of my friends are on Instagramâ€”but I mostly watched Reels anyway!
I do miss Mastodon.
I now use YouTube in Safari with [shorts blocked](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/blockyt-for-safari/id1575379461?l=en-GB).
This creates enough friction for me to watch videos intentionally (most of the
time).
It also lets me use cool extensions like [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
and [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/).

And when Apple Intelligence (if you can call it that) got to Europe, I turned
on the new _Reduce Interruptions_ focus and never turned it off.
This works great because it randomly lets things through, but blocks most of it.

I tried a dumb phone[^3], but this was _way_ too much frictionâ€”I need a usable
phone for renting a bike, getting my parcels, etc.

In March I bought a [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com) and started
tracking my tasks there instead of my phone.
I also started journalling and tracking my habits and I love the analog
lifestyleâ€”even my running plan is analog!

The combination of all of this is working out pretty well so far:
My phone is mostly boring.
It doesn't have any exciting apps.
It doesn't _spark joy_.
Because of this, I'm spending my time a lot more intentional.

That being said, sometimes I spend a little too much time on YouTube (at least
that's longform content) and I should probably delete the Slack app to not check
the work chat when I'm not at my desk.

## We deserve more humane tech

I'm happy to see the first smartphone vendors start to add physical switches
to their phones to disable connectivity or limit apps[^4] and maybe I'll switch
to one of them one day.

This is not a political post, but if it was, it would talk about the obscene
power of big tech and the necessity to regulate and break up.
It would appeal on you to rethink your investment into these services, services
that are actively spying on you, services that exploit your mental health for
the sake of raising shareholder value.

Now go, touch some grass[^5]. ðŸŒ±
