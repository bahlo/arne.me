Hi, how was your week?
Remember the article in [last weeks issue](/weekly/94) titled [8 Ways to Read (a Lot) More Books This Year](https://click.arne.me?issue=95&url=https://hbr.org/2017/02/8-ways-to-read-a-lot-more-books-this-year)? 
That really resonated with me and Iâ€˜ve completed [two](/books/never-split-the-difference) [books](/books/engineering-management-for-the-rest-of-us) since and started a
third.
