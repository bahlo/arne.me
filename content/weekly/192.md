> Friendzone works as your second brain for relationships, helping you nurture your connections through timely reminders and organized conversation tracking.

I already showed you Friendzone, the app my friend Jan is building, in [issue #180](/weekly/180).
I've been using it since the early TestFlight releases and it's helped me keep in touch with friends and family members that I otherwise wouldn't have.
It's an incredible app that you can [download today in the Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/personal-crm-friendzone/id6472595588)!

Here are five codes that'll get you three additional free months after the trial (first come, first served):
