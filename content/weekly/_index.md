Arne's Weekly is my newsletter, where I collect interesting stories from all
over the web every sunday.
It's meant to be consumed via email and the archives are always a week behind,
so make sure to [subscribe](https://arnesweekly.email) if you haven't already.

The archives also have an [RSS Feed](/weekly/atom.xml).
