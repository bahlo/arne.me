Hey hey,

I‘m taking a break from this newsletter.

I love reading and sharing all these interesting, sometimes polarizing, stories
with you all and I thoroughly enjoyed the notes of encouragement some of you
sent over the years.

But sometimes things that are really fun for a long time suddenly become another
item on your to-do list; an obligation.
The newsletter is taking up space in my head and time in my weekend that I would
sometimes rather spend reading a newspaper or a book or nothing at all.

Maybe I‘ll come back in a month because I miss it, maybe not.
In any case, here are some of my favourite newsletters, to fill the
Arne‘s Weekly-shaped hole in your weekend:

* [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com) by Kale Davis
* [Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com) by Kai Brach
* [Weekend Reading](https://labnotes.org) by Assaf Arkin
* [Links I Would Gchat You If We Were Friends](https://linksiwouldgchatyou.substack.com) by Caitlin Dewey
* [software lead weekly](https://softwareleadweekly.com) by Oren Ellenbogen

xoxo<br>
Arne
