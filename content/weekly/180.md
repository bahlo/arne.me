## Projects of Friends: Friendzone

![Three screenshots showing people avatars, upcoming birthdays and notes](/weekly/180/friendzone-screens-medium@2x.png)

Do you struggle to remember people's birthdays?
Do you have a huge note on your phone with gift ideas?
Do you sometimes forget something a friend or relative told you a while ago?

My friend [Jan](https://coolcut.lol) built an app called Friendzone, that helps
you manage and elevate your relationships.
You can set a regular catch-up interval to get reminded to reach out, you get
birthday reminders and you can write gift ideas and notes for your friends and
family.

This is one of the apps that stay true to what Steve Jobs called "bicycle for
the mind": Friendzone stays out of your way but supports you in your daily life.
