## Culture
* [High quality audio makes you sound smarter](https://tips.ariyh.com/p/good-sound-quality-smarter)  
If you don't have a proper microphone in your home-office, definitely get one if you can afford it. [Wirecutter's budget pick](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-usb-microphone/) is 45 $.
* [Embrace the Grind](https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind)  
Jacob Kaplan-Moss talks about how if you put enough effort in something it seems like magic to other people.
* [Don’t hire top talent; hire for weaknesses](https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2021/04/10/dont-hire-top-talent-hire-for-weaknesses/)  
Great writeup by Benji Weber about the talent vs. the weaknesses mindset when hiring people.

## Rust
* [Rust is for Professionals](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/13/rust-is-for-professionals)  
Gregory Szorc writes what is more an essay than a blog post about Rust and what he likes about it. This is a must read if you want to know why so many people like Rust.
* [Linus Torwalds about Rust in the Linux Kernel](https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1099)  
Very interesting concerns, mostly about runtime-panics (e.g. when running out of memory). I hope this gets resolved, can't wait for a safer linux kernel.
* [Why Rust strings seem hard](https://www.brandons.me/blog/why-rust-strings-seem-hard)  
Brandon Smith dives into Rusts string management in comparison with other languages. 

## Go
* [What's the `sync.Cond`](https://dtyler.io/articles/2021/04/13/sync_cond)  
If you've never used a condvar, definitely check out this article by Hidetatsu Yaginuma. 
* [Idiomatic pancis in Go](https://stonecode.ca/idiomatic-panics/)  
Even though usually frowned-upon, there definitely are situations where a panic is the best choice.
* [My Go Executable Files Are Still Getting Larger](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/go-file-size-update)  
Raphael 'kena' Poss compares the size of CockroachDB binaries and explains how it evolved over different Go versions.
* [Go is a great programming language](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/02/Go-is-a-great-language.html)  
Drew DeVault about why he thinks Go is the best programming language ever made. _Internet programming language_ is a very fitting description for Go in my opinion.

## Watching
* [This Smart Home Isn't Stupid](https://youtu.be/85yH56DS5mg)  
Quinn Nelson talks about his smart-home setup, his set of rules for smart devices (which you should definitely adopt) and shows parts of his setup.
* [We Are In A "FOURTH TURNING," What Does That Mean?](https://youtu.be/xeVyfiP0cLk)  
Van Neistat (the Spirited Man) about the 1997 book, THE FOURTH TURNING and how history repeats itself every 80 years (according to the book). His YouTube channel is only a month old and already full of great content.

## Tools and code
* [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)  
Style definitions for nice terminal layouts. Can't wait to use this!
* [xplr](https://github.com/sayanarijit/xplr)  
A hackable, minimal, fast TUI file explorer.

## Cutting Room Floor
* [SQLite is the only database you will ever need in most cases](https://unixsheikh.com/articles/sqlite-the-only-database-you-will-ever-need-in-most-cases.html)  
I definitely am guilty of using a Postgres database where SQLite would've sufficed. Re-read this before adding Postgres to your next project.
* [Creating Security Decision Trees With Graphviz](https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/security-decision-trees-with-graphviz)  
Kelly Shortridge about creating a graph for your attack vectors. I'm definitely going to do this. (This is also a good reference on making Graphviz look good.)
