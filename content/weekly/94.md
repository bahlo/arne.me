Hey hey, hope your week was good! 🙌🏻

## Toot of the Week
> a guide to greetings:
> 
> "hi guys": excludes non-guys  
> "ladies and gentlemen": excludes non-binary people, and men who aren't gentle  
> "hey folks": a bit too predictable  
> "hello fortnite gamers": surprising and equally offensive to everyone, the ideal choice
