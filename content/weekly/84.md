### [Fn(), Functional Programming for Golang](https://click.arne.me?issue=84&url=https://github.com/kamstrup/fn)

_github.com/kamstrup_

Kamstrup built a functional programming library for Go, inspired by Clojure and
the Java Streams API. It allows you to write code like this:

```go
// Get all users without a name.
fn.ArrayOf(users).Where(fn.Not((*User).HasName))
```
