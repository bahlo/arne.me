This book was tough, I was angry a lot.

Yuval Noah Harari starts by explaining how humanity has solved 
famine, plague and war and will therefore focus on advancing humans 
themselves (even if you ignore COVID-19 and the Ukraine invasion, 
what about the climate crisis?).
God is dead and the new religion, Humanism, has the goal to create super-humans, 
therefore creating the next evolutionary stage after Homo Sapiens: Homo Deus.

He's talking about consciousness, how it will be decoupled from intelligence 
and how every living being, including humans, is just a complex algorithm that 
we'll just reverse-engineer and recreate in the future ("there is no human 
touch").

Harari makes it hard to distinguish between fact and opinion because everything 
is presented as a fact. Even if there are references that are supposed to back 
it up, they often only cover a very small part of the statement.
And the statements are wild. At one point he's saying that national socialism is 
just a variant of humanism (see this statement by Humanists UK: [Yuval Noah Harari and ‘humanism’
](https://humanists.uk/humanism/humanism-today/yuval-noah-harari-humanism/)).

I would've given this book a two-star rating but I've read this in a book club 
and what this book actually does well is sparking discussions and making you 
think about these topics.
