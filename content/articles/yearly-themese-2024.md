Instead of setting a fixed goal as my New Year's resolution, only to then not 
even make it through January, I'm setting Yearly Themes.
CGP Grey has a [great video on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), 
here's a quote:

> For some things, precision matters, for others, it doesn't and when trying 
> to build yourself into a better version of yourself, exact data points don't 
> matter.
> All that matters, is the trend line.

Yearly Themes act as a signpost to give your year a direction—the idea is to 
keep them in mind when making decisions, no matter how small. 

## Looking back at 2023

My 2023 started with two themes:

Year of Business

: In the past, most of my side projects were open-source and/or non-profit.
  I wanted to dive into figuring out if side projects with actual revenue was
  something I wanted to pursue.

Year of Adventure

: I have a desk job and work from home and while I enjoy watching outdoor 
  media, I have very little actual experience.

In the second half of 2023 I switched themes[^1] to:

Year of Balance

: My time is mostly divided into family, work, side projects and leisure. 
  I want to be conscious of keeping a balance in my time invested.

I'm okay with how Year of Business and Year of Adventure went; I have a better 
idea of what it takes to turn a hobby project into something that generates 
revenue, and we're leasing an orchard[^2].

Year of Balance went really well, I'm now doing a better job allocating the time 
to what's important to me.

## Yearly Themes 2024

These are my Yearly Themes for next year:

Year of Fillilng The Gaps

: I've made progress in many areas in my life over the last few years. I feel
  like that created "gaps" in some less interesting areas. This year, I want to 
  invest in these areas to raise the overall base-line of myself.

Year of Fitness

: After doing _Year of Health_ at twice, I aim to focus on improving, instead 
  of maintaining, my fitness. One metric for this could be my 
  [VO₂ max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max), which my Apple Watch 
  conveniently automatically records for me[^3].

## What's yours?

Do you do New Year's resolutions or Yearly Themes, or something entirely 
different? What do they look like? I'd love to [hear from you](/contact).
