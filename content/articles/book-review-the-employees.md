This book is strange.

It's a collection of numbered statements from human and humanoid employees on a 
space ship after the crew took on some "objects" from the planet 
_New Discovery_. 
The statements are not ordered so you only get pieces to the puzzle and nothing 
makes sense in the beginning.

I loved the weird and unique way of storytelling and how it showed different 
perspectives, struggles and tensions. 
The "objects" were weird, I can’t imagine what they‘re like (maybe that’s the 
point).

Not an easy read, but if you‘re into dystopian sci-fi I would recommend it.
