The year is 1996. 
You feed your Tamagotchi, get a Squeezit and turn on the home computer. 
You've told your family they can't do phone calls for the next hour. 
The dial-up modem makes beeping sounds[^1]. 
You're online.

Yesterday you found this fly website about amateur radio, and you want to 
explore moreâ€”but how can you find related websites? 
Yahoo is slow and not really showing you what you're looking for.
Then you notice that this website is part of the "Amateur Radio Webring".
You click the arrow to the right and dive into another website about amateur
radio. 

<!-- more -->

You wake up.

The year is 2023. 
You can no longer get a Squeezit anywhere, you live under surveillance 
capitalism and the 
[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) is ruining 
the web.
You found this goofy personal website, and you'd like to browse similar ones.
What do you do? 
Find the person on socials, look at who they're following and check if they have 
a website?

It's time to bring webrings back.

Introducing the [Fire Chicken Webring](https://firechicken.club); an invite-only 
webring for personal websites.
You can explore this webring by going to the footer of this website and 
clicking on either arrow to navigate to another personal website.

If we're friends, or I follow you anywhere, [@ me](/contact) and I'll add you.
If not, here's some other modern webrings[^2]:
[Hotline Webring](https://hotlinewebring.club), 
[Sidebar.io Webring](https://sidebar.io/webring),
[a11y-webring.club](https://a11y-webring.club),
