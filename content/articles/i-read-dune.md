This book sat on my shelf for the better part of last year. 
After reading a few non-fiction books I longed for a novel and decided to pick 
up Dune.

It took me the first 100 pages to really get into it, but then I was immerged
into the fascinating world of the desert planet Arrakis (or "Dune") with its 
sand worms, the Bene Gesserit sisterhood with superhuman powers, the native 
Freemen who learned to live in the harsh environment, the intrigues, the 
politics and the religion.

I loved to see the evolution of the main character from being a royal youth from 
House Altreides to leading the native Freemen as Muad'Dib. 

This quote really stood out to me, as it's still relevant today:

> Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. 
> But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.

Can't wait to read the other books in the Dune series!
