A podcast I did with my good friend [Jan](https://jan.work) in German.
We talked about tech and productivity, our side projects, our home screens and 
once a year held a gala to select the best apps, music and more.

If you want to get started, I recommend one of these episodes:

* [SN017 Das letzte gute soziale Netzwerk](https://sprachnachrichten.fm/episoden/17)
* [SN014 Ganz sch√∂n Zettelig](https://sprachnachrichten.fm/episoden/14)
* [SN007 Banking](https://sprachnachrichten.fm/episoden/7)
