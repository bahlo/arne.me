title: "HomeMatic ChurchTools Plugin"
from: 2023

This project connects the smart home system 
[HomeMatic](https://homematic-ip.com) to the church organization tool 
[ChurchTools](https://www.church.tools), exposing a virtual remote that toggles
if an even in a ChurchTools room started or stopped.

This allows administrators to control their heating and other appliances only
when needed, saving energy and time.

It's currently in the early-access phase so [@ me](/contact) if you want to give
it a try.
