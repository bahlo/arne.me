Every month, I'm sharing my current home screen.

<!-- more -->

This is the one for March 2024.
Notable changes since [my last post in February](/home-screens/2024-02):

- The Home widget is gone, replaced by Carrot Weather
- Music is replaced by [Manet](https://tilo.dev/manet/), highly recommended
- Slack is on the Home Screen. Yes, I know.
- Obsidian is gone (I just don't use it much on mobile right now)

After that comes three rows of apps: Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, YNAB, CouchTimes, BeReal, Gentler Streak, Photos, Overcast, Calendar, Mail, Camera. The Dock has four apps: Safari, Messages, OmniFocus and Manet." />
