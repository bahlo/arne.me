Every month, I'm sharing my current home screen. 

<!-- more -->

This is the one for January 2024.
Notable changes since [my last post in December](/articles/home-screen-december-2023):

- I switched from Apple Music to Doppler
- No more weather widget (I mostly look at the watch for weather)
- I'm using [a wallpaper](https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/auroraborealisgradient) on the home screen again!

Then thereâ€™s three rows of apps: CouchTimes, WhatsApp, Signal, Obsidian, Gentler Streak YNAB, BeReal, Home, Overcast, Calendar, Photos, Camera. The Dock has three apps: Safari, Messages and OmniFocus." />
