Every month, I'm sharing my current home screen.
This is the one for November 2023.

<!-- more -->

Notable changes since [my last post in October](https://spezi.social/@arne/111210401201738206):

- Black background is back!
- I'm now using the new iOS 17 Overcast widget.
- Obsidian has made it back to the home screen.
- I'm evaluating OmniFocus 4 again after switching to Things because of speed
  issues[^1].

At the top are two small widgets: CARROT weather and Overcast. Below that are three rows of apps: CouchTimes, WhatsApp, Signal, Obsidian, Gentler Streak, BeReal, Music, Photos, Ivory, HEY, Calendar and Camera. The dock has three apps: Safari, Messages & OmniFocus 4" />

All in all I'm still very happy with the layout. Two small widgets, three rows
of apps and a three apps in the dock works really well for me.

    It's a beta, so this is expectedâ€”I'm sure they'll be ironed out in the
    coming weeks.
