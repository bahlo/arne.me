    An iOS home screen with a black background and a medium Home.app widget at the top, showing 8 devices or scenes. Then there's a small CouchTimes widget showing the next unwatched episode of Sex Education. After that comes three rows of apps: Gentler Streak, Obsidian, WhatsApp, Signal, Music, BeReal, YNAB, Photos, Overcast, Calendar, Mail and Camera. The Dock has three apps: Safari, Messages and OmniFocus.

Every month, I'm sharing my current home screen.
This is the one for February 2024.

Notable changes since [my last post in January](/home-screens/2024-01):

- I moved away from HEY. Still miss it, but it's not worth the drama.
- Doppler is gone for now, still figuring out how I want to listen to music.
- Trying a medium Home widget at the top, we'll see if it sticks.
- CouchTimes has widgets now!
- I already miss my empty bottom row.
