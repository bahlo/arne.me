Every month, I'm sharing my current home screen.
This is the one for December 2023.

<!-- more -->

Notable changes since [my last post in November](/articles/home-screen-november-2023):

- Switched from Overcast to the Calendar widget. Mostly because Overcast 
  only shows the last podcast and I switch regularly.
- Obsidian is gone, I don't use it as much on mobile as I thought.
- YNAB is back on the home screen (and already has a badge lol).

At the top are two small widgets: CARROT weather and Calendar. Below that are three rows of apps: CouchTimes, WhatsApp, Signal, Ivory, Gentler Streak, BeReal, YNAB, Photos, Overcast, Music, HEY and Camera. The dock has three apps: Safari, Messages & OmniFocus 4" />
