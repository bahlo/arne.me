Almost every month, Iâ€™m sharing my current home screen. This is the one for May 
2024.

Notable changes since [my last post in March](/home-screens/2024-03):

* No background image anymore (old-school!)
* Slack is gone
* [Manet](https://tilo.dev/manet/) moved out of the dock (I can't shake the three-app-dock)
* [Bootsschule1](https://bootsschule1.app/) moved in
