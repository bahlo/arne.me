When I bought this book I was hyped—the topic is something I'm thinking about a
lot. If Cal Newport endorses the book, it has to be good, right?

Ali Abdaal takes on the hustle culture and shows techniques to feel good while
still being productive.
The book is split into three parts: Energize, Unblock and Sustain, which are
again split into three chapters each.
Every chapter talks about a specific component of "feel-good productivity", like
Play, Clarity or Recharge.
Almost all the points are made through anecdotes or explaining scientific
experiments.

I had a hard time trying to find value in this book[^1], most points seem known
and obvious.
If this were a book without the anecdotes and experiments, it could probably
fit on 20 pages, and I would enjoy it a lot more.

Should you read this? I don’t know.
