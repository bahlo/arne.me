In need of more electricity, humanity has set up generators 3 kilometers below
the sea-level, feeding off a deep-sea vulcano.
These generators need humans to keep them running, but not everyone
is cut out for it, only "pre-adapted" peopleâ€”those used to broken bodies and
chronic stress.
These _rifters_ live in _Beebe_, a capsule chained to the bottom of the sea. 
They went through operations to be able to breathe sea-water and withstand the
pressure.

Most of the story takes place under water.
Peter Watts writes from different perspectives, but mostly about Lenie Clarke,
one of the rifters.
I really like how the sci-fi parts make the rifters adapt to the deep sea, how
they get used to being in almost complete darkness, how it subtly changes them.
The _Smart Gels_ (organic brain-like computers, also called _head cheese_)
remind me of today's LLMs: Nobody trusts them, they're basically black boxes and
they don't understand the first thing about language.

If you like reading deep-sea sci-fi and don't mind a dark story, give this a
read!
