_(I read this book in German; at the time of writing there‘s no English translation available.)_

A video goes viral, showing a sixteen-year-old girl getting abused. Yasira Saad, a BKA[^1] inspector, takes the case of finding the attackers and the girl, who went missing a few days earlier. The video sparks national uproar and a new violent far-right movement is getting traction. Will Yasira solve the case before more people get hurt?

I’ve enjoyed every book by Marc-Uwe Kling so far and this is no exception, although it‘s very different than the others—the first crime story. It‘s hard to put the book away, and I love that it‘s very close to the Zeitgeist.

If you like thrilling crime stories and a bit of social criticism, this book is for you. Just be careful, parts of the book are disturbing.
