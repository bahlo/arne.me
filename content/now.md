* Getting into Nix(OS) and setting it up on my servers
* Modding an iPod 5.5 to add SD storage and a larger battery
* Setting Emacs from scratch for personal organisation (Org mode) and software 
  development (see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/bahlo/dotfiles))
* Work on my digital garden, [Arnes Notes](https://notes.arne.me). I add notes almost every day but it also lacks some features I like to see (e.g. search) 

This page is inspired by [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com).
