* Reading [The Managers Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/)
* Getting into Emacs for personal organisation (Org mode) and software development (see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/bahlo/dotfiles))
* Getting back into working out regularly (which is a challenge with the heat)
* Work on my digital garden, [Arnes Notes](https://notes.arne.me). I add notes almost every day but it also lacks some features I like to see (e.g. search) 
* Work on this website, which is heavily in progress as you can probably tell
* Move some web sites and applications to a server I manage myself (maybe with [K3s](https://notes.arne.me/k3s))

This page is inspired by [NowNowNow](https://nownownow.com).
