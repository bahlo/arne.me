When I first heard of this book I immediately dismissed it, mostly due to the
title sounding weird to me.
But this book popped up again on reading lists and recommendation threads all 
over the internet and people were praising it. 
When I finally decided to check it out, I was pleasantly surprised.

Dale Carnegie shares 30 principles for dealing with people in four parts: 
1. Fundamental techniques in handling people
2. Six ways to make people like you
3. Win people to your way of thinking
4. Be a leader.

Each principle is annotated with anecdotes from famous people or reports from
people that attended his courses. 
These can feel arbitrary and constructed, especially towards the end, but they
do show how a principle can be applied in practice.

This was nonetheless a great read and I recommend giving this a try, 
there's lots of good advice and I sincerely believe it will elevate how you 
deal with people.
