    letâ€™s all go back to internet 1.0.  
    you can only connect to it through a black and white macintosh, and the only things there are a chatroom and movie times. no browsers. no sites. and you can only connect late in the evening when no one is expecting a phone call. oh and youâ€™re charged by the minute. itâ€™s beautiful.
