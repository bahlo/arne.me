One of my best friends, [Jan FrÃ¼chtl](https://jan.work), has released his side 
project, [CouchTimes](https://couchtim.es)!
It's an iOS-native, simple and elegant TV show tracker.

Add all your favourite shows to the watchlist, pin the ones you're watching or 
want to watch (who's excited for the new season of Black Mirror?) and mark 
episodes as seen quickly with a swipe.
Maintain a list of all-time favourites so you'll never come up empty if asked
for a recommendation.
And if you drop your phone, all your TV shows and the progress is saved 
securely in iCloud.
Did I mention there's no tracking? 

Go download CouchTimes today from the 
[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/couchtimes-tv-show-tracker/id1661813375), 
it's free!
