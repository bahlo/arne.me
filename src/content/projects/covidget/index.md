An iOS app I wrote to play around with widgets when they were new in iOS 14.
It allowed you to select a German district and would automatically fetch the 
recent numbers and show them in grey, orange or red, depending how big the 
number is.

I submitted it to the App Store but got rejected because of a rule that says
I can only use data of my own service, not directly call the RKI 
(The German federal government agency responsible for disease control and 
prevention).
