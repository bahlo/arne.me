Chris Voss makes this non-fiction book exciting by telling stories from real 
hostage negotiations from his time at the FBI.
Each chapter is about a specific tactic and filled with psychological 
information as well as real-world experience and has a nice summary at the end 
(remind me to collate those into my notes).
