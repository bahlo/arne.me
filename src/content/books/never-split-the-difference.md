This book is thrilling as Chris Voss tells stories from real (sometimes hostage) 
negotiations from his time at the FBI and explains how and why his tactics work. 
If I every ask you „How am I supposed to do that?“, it‘s about to get real. 
Every chapter has a nice summary at the end (remind me to collate those into my 
notes) and it reads like a fiction book.
