Here are five cool things:
- Portable espresso machine
- Smart water bottle
- Foldable electric bike
- Levitating Bluetooth speaker
- Robotic vacuum cleaner

And here is random code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```
